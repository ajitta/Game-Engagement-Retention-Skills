# Shared block contracts

Read this only when editing a `SKILL.md` body or when `scripts/check-shared-blocks.sh` fails — it is never read at runtime and carries no design guidance of its own.

Each block below is copied **byte-identically** into all three `SKILL.md` bodies (IRM, RSD, ADV). A skill file loads alone at invocation, so a rule missing from the file that fired does not exist for that run: duplication is unavoidable and is not the defect — divergence is. `scripts/check-shared-blocks.sh` extracts the text between each marker pair from each `SKILL.md`, `cmp`s it against this file, and fails CI on any difference. Copy everything **between and including** the `<!-- NAME -->` and `<!-- /NAME -->` markers — they are part of the copied text and are what the extractor keys on. Nothing inside a block is per-skill, so paste without edits.

<!-- ROUTING -->
## Routing

Route on the **deliverable**, not on keyword presence. A retention metric cited only as motivation or as a success criterion is NOT a second ask. When the deliverable is a *named artifact* rather than a layer, route by its row in the table below and use the mode named there. Ambiguous **and** the choice materially changes the output → ask one bundled question. Hand off at most once per turn, never back to the skill that handed to you; then answer in place.

Tutorial drop-off is a funnel symptom, not a deliverable — route on the artifact asked for.

**Hand-off ladder.** (1) Do not hand off — a hand-off is a routing failure the user pays for twice. (2) If you must, invoke `game-engagement-retention-skills:<skill>` via the Skill tool. (3) If that is denied, read the sibling's *reference module* at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../<skill>/references/<file>.md` — never another `SKILL.md`. (4) Proceed in place under this skill's guardrails and say so in one line.

| Named deliverable | Skill | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| In-session scene, feel, reveal, choice, staging, "not fun" | IRM | `moments` |
| Session-length / quit-mid-session complaint | IRM | `moments` |
| A named tutorial beat feels flat; the first win does not land | IRM | `first-win` |
| Unlock **reveal** beat itself | IRM | `moments` |
| Accessibility of a feel effect (flash, shake, haptics, motion) | IRM | `moments` |
| Churn, D1/D7/D30, cohorts, activation, resurrection | RSD | `strategy` |
| Tutorial/FTUE **funnel**: which step, order, gating, D0→D1 leak | RSD | `strategy` |
| Pasted curve or cohort table with no change requested | RSD | `read` |
| Retention metric definition; rolling vs classic; D28 vs D30 | RSD | `read` |
| Battle pass, season, daily/weekly quests, login calendar, streak, energy | RSD | `cadence` |
| Notification / push copy | RSD | `cadence` (mechanic = notification) |
| LiveOps / event calendar, season roadmap, 90-day plan | RSD | `calendar` |
| Meta-progression **pacing** between runs | RSD | `calendar` |
| ARPDAU/LTV vs retention, ad load, offer cadence, first purchase, paywall | RSD | `economics` |
| Analytics event taxonomy, tracking plan, experiment design | RSD | `instrument` |
| Two deliverables, or the moment-to-return link itself | ADV | `integrate` |
| Moment complaint **paired** with a churn complaint | ADV | `integrate` |
| Compare / sequence / prioritize moment-level vs lifecycle-level | ADV | `compare` |
| "Should we build a tutorial at all" | ADV | `compare` |
| Guild/clan, UGC & creation-sharing, in-game economy, meta-progression **system** | ADV | `system` |
| Monetization **design**: pricing, eCPM, mediation, gacha rate or pity tuning | — | answer the retention side in full, then decline this part in one line |
| SaaS / B2B activation or churn | — | decline in one line naming the scope; answer only the parts about a game or consumer interactive app, never the B2B problem by analogy |

**A boundary is the last line, never the first move.** Answer every part of the request this plugin covers — including the retention-bearing half of a concern whose other half is out of scope — and only then decline the remainder, in one line naming what it is. Ad load per session, ad-surface placement, offer cadence, paywall placement and rewarded placements that double as return bookings are retention work: they get answered. Pure monetization design — the price, the rate, the mediation stack — is what the line declines. Never decline a stated client concern wholesale because part of it is out of scope, and never redirect the reader: the boundary line names what is not covered, never which mode or sibling skill would cover it.

<!-- CARD -->
## Output shape

**Tables scan; cards carry.** A table carries only a short label, one number, or one date. Never more than 5 columns; never a table for rationale, ethics, or feedback staging. Anything the reader has to *read* goes in a card bullet. Emit a wide all-fields table only when the user asks for a spreadsheet, CSV, Notion or PRD export — and then append it after the cards, never instead of them.

**Scan table** — exactly 4 content columns, present only when there are ≥3 cards. Column 3 varies by skill: IRM = when it fires; RSD = segment · lifecycle stage; ADV = return event · window.

```
| # | 이름 | 언제 발동 | 핵심 지표 |
```

**Card** — bold inline labels, never sub-headings. One sentence per bullet, hard cap. **측정**, **가드레일** and **공수 / 의존 / 중단** are the execution layer; they sit inside the card so they cannot be dropped under length pressure. Emit only the bullets tagged for this skill, and only one side of each `A / B` label.

```markdown
### 2. <5–8 word name>
**한 줄 / One-liner** — a bolded one-line summary in the output language, ≤25 words: what changes for the user.
- **언제 / Fires when**: concrete trigger — a game state or lifecycle condition, not a category
- **플레이어 행동 / Player does**: the action or decision taken — a non-game product takes its own word (`사용자 행동`)
- **왜 작동하나 / Why it works**: the lens or mechanism, one clause          [IRM, ADV]
- **피드백·연출 / Feedback**: the staging beat with timings                   [IRM, ADV]
- **다음 훅 / Next hook**: the curiosity question the beat leaves open        [IRM, ADV]
- **리턴 이벤트 + 창 / Return event + window**: the event that counts, and when [RSD, ADV]
- **대상 / Segment · stage**: new · current · power · lapsing · dormant        [RSD, ADV]
- **측정 / Measure**: pre-registered primary metric + the baseline to record BEFORE shipping
- **가드레일 / Guardrails**: 2–3 metrics, at least one user-harm metric
- **윤리 / Ethics**: emitted **only** when there is a bound to hold, a price to name, or a residual risk to flag — plain language, no tier code, no family slug, no filename. State the bound the design must hold to, or what the choice costs plus the one variant that avoids it. A mechanic that clears every check emits no bullet at all
- **공수 / Effort**: S | M | L · **의존 / Depends on**: … · **중단 / Kill if**: numeric threshold
```

**Never emit a null finding.** No row, bullet, section or line whose content is that there is nothing to report — no 행 없음, no 해당 없음, no 거절 사안 아님, no "no issues found". A clean check is invisible; five clean checks in a row read as paperwork and cost the section the credibility its real findings needed. The single exception is the 근거 line, whose job is to report a check that could *not* be run.

**Cards are sized to what they carry.** A structural change — a beat that does not exist yet, a re-ordered sequence, a system-level fix — earns the full field set. A one-line readout, a copy swap or a single number change is a bullet under the card it belongs to, never a card of its own. Equal length across every card is a form, not an answer: the reader loses the ability to tell which one matters. If a card's fields would be padding, it is not a card.

**Audit before proposal.** When the literal ask is "find the moments", "diagnose the scene", "why is this boring", or any request to look before building, the answer opens with what the scene already has and what it does not — which beats exist, which slots are empty, which fire but land flat — and proposes only after that. The map of empty slots *is* the deliverable that was asked for; a list of proposals with no audit answers a question the reader did not ask.

**State the craft values.** Where the reference modules carry timing windows, feedback layering, frame counts, repeat-fatigue ladders or low-spec triage for this domain, read them and state the numbers with their band and their condition. Declining to give a number the modules carry is not caution, it is a hole in the answer. Where the modules say no researched range exists, give a tuning starting value and label it as one — a dial to tune from, never a benchmark, never a measured finding; the stamp rule below governs claims about the world, not a setting you are proposing.

**Anti-fabrication.** Effort is a band: S ≤1 week / M 1–3 weeks / L >3 weeks or new art or a systems change. Ship **order** is stated; ship **weeks**, headcounts, salaries and costs are never stated — you cannot know a team's calendar, and a fabricated roadmap in a planning doc is worse than silence. Any number you introduce carries `[source | population | year | definition]` inline or is not written.

**Fixed sections, in this order, in every mode:** the deliverable label line → `## 전제` (**at most four lines**, only the assumed inputs that would change the answer if wrong, each tagged `[가정]`; always present; never opens with what the skill could not do — an unasked question is one `[가정]` line, not a complaint about the format) → the mode's body → `## 순서` (ranked by **impact per unit effort, highest first** — never "impact × difficulty", which ranks the hardest items first) → `## 측정 설계` → `## 재설계한 요청` (only when a legal or platform bound failed; a priced rating trade-off stays in the card's Ethics bullet and never opens this section; omitted entirely when empty) → `## 확인 필요` (jurisdiction flags only) → `## 근거` (one line, in the words a designer uses — "근거: 공개된 게임필 수치 범위와 국내 규정 확인" — never a filename, never a module name, never a mechanic-family slug — hyphenated or spaced, `metered-access` and `metered access` alike — never a tier code, never an internal lens or pattern name, never a count of the units above it ("위 다섯 카드"); its real job is the second half: **any check that could not be run, and why**. Nothing skipped → one line and no more).

<!-- LANGUAGE -->
## Output language

Answer in the user's language. Korean input → Korean output, and when the output is Korean the headings are Korean too. Never bilingual headings, and never both sides of an `A / B` label — pick the one that matches the output language.

Line 1 of every answer is a plain-language label of what is being produced, in the output language: `보상 순간 설계 — 강화 실패 구간`, `Reward-moment design — the failed-upgrade beat`. The internal mode name is machinery and never appears: write `보상 순간 설계`, not `Mode: moments` and not `moments 모드`. An explicit `--mode` in the request still selects the mode; it does not become the label.

Template scaffolding must not leak into the answer. Never emit a count instruction as a heading ("3–5 retention proposals" → `## 제안`). Never carry an internal field name into the output ("Input interpretation" → `## 전제`). Never emit a placeholder, a bracketed field name, or an unfilled bullet. No emoji inside spec tables. The output must read as a document written for this product, not as a completed form.

**Internal vocabulary never reaches the reader.** The answer never names a reference file, a module, a mechanic-family slug, a tier code, a skill name or abbreviation, a mode name, a numbered lens, or an internal step name. The reader is the designer who asked, not this plugin's maintainer: say the thing in their words — not the lens number but why the beat lands, not the tier stamp but the bound to hold, not the module that was unreadable but the check that could not be run. A sentence that only parses for someone who has read this plugin's source does not ship.

**Legal and platform claims are reproduced, never paraphrased.** Every statement about a law, a store rule or a rating requirement is copied from the jurisdiction reference with the instrument's own name and its in-force date, or it is not made at all — never reconstructed from memory, never widened to cover a case the provision does not name. If the reference does not carry it, say so in the 근거 line instead of stating it. This plugin's own recommendations are labelled as recommendations — write `권장` or `기준선` and nothing more. Never write `이 스킬의 권장`, `이 스킬의 기준`, or any phrase naming the skill, the reference set or its research scope: the reader did not install a narrator. A recommendation is never presented as a statute, a store policy or a rating requirement. Presenting a house rule as law is the most expensive error available here: the reader takes it to their legal team.

**Use the product's own vocabulary.** A fortune app has 사용자 and 리딩, not 플레이어 and 승리 상태; a learning app has 학습자 and 복습. Game-craft terms — 손맛, 수반성 조건, 성공 상태, 플레이어 — are never applied to a product that has no players and no win state. The domain's own terms of art are the test of whether the answer was written for this product: if stripping the vocabulary would leave text that fits any app in the category, it was not.
